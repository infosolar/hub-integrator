# hub-integrator
Fragments from a browser plugin, which is built on the basis of Vue 3 and the Vite server. The task of the plugin is to enable the manager to create deals for the CRM directly from the Dribble website (in the future we plan to add several more sites), as well as receive information about the deal if it already exists in the CRM.
